# CS-255-Systems Analysis & Design 

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project aimed to assist customers in achieving a higher success rate on their driving tests. The client, DriverPass, sought to develop a comprehensive system offering various paid services. The system was designed to provide three distinct packages to clients. The first package included three driving lessons, the second offered four driving lessons along with an in-person explanation of DMV rules and policies, and the third package provided six driving lessons, the in-person explanation, as well as access to online content, materials, and tests. The project involved the creation of a website accessible to both DriverPass employees and clients, which could be accessed from mobile devices and computers. The website allowed clients to register, view their profiles online, and reset their passwords. Additionally, DriverPass employees had the ability to book, modify, or cancel lessons for clients upon request. Clients were also empowered to create, modify, or cancel driving lessons through their profiles. Access to online content, materials, and tests was granted to clients who had purchased the corresponding package. Furthermore, the system allowed driving instructors to leave notes for their students, which could be accessed through student profiles ("DriverPass interview transcript," n.d.).

What aspects of your work on these documents do you believe were particularly strong?

I believe I excelled in identifying the project requirements and conducting thorough research to find optimal solutions that fulfilled these requirements.

If you could choose one aspect of your work on these documents to revise, what would you select? How would you enhance it?

I would choose to improve my UML class diagram, as I found this task particularly challenging. I am aware that there are areas in which it could be enhanced. To improve my proficiency in creating this type of diagram, I would dedicate more time to practice. While I possessed a solid understanding of the system's requirements and desired processes, I encountered difficulty in architecting the system. The creation of a class diagram involves modeling data in an object-oriented manner, including classes, variables, and processes (Valacich & George, 2020, p. 277). Due to my limited experience in this area, I struggled with determining the appropriate classes and their interactions. I encountered issues related to avoiding process duplication, especially concerning the administrator role, which had broader permissions compared to other roles ("DriverPass interview transcript," n.d.). Consequently, I faced challenges in including processes without repeating them.

How did you interpret the user's needs and incorporate them into your system design? Why is it crucial to consider the user's needs during the design process?

I interpreted the user's needs by transforming them into specific requirements, which served as the foundation for creating various system diagrams. For example, I developed a use case diagram that illustrated all the processes fulfilling the user's needs directly. Considering these needs during the design process is crucial to ensure the resulting system is not only functional but also user-friendly. The DriverPass system was developed with the aim of assisting users in passing their DMV driving test, meaning every aspect of the system should revolve around achieving this goal ("DriverPass interview transcript," n.d.). If the system fails to fulfill its intended purpose, it becomes redundant, leading to user dissatisfaction.  

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Software development follows a structured approach known as the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) (Valacich & George, 2020, p. 6). While various methodologies exist, a fundamental SDLC framework comprises several stages: planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance (Valacich & George, 2020, p. 7).

The process of analyzing and designing a system begins with the planning phase. During this phase, system requirements are collected from the customer. In the subsequent analysis phase, extensive research is conducted to understand the users' expectations and desires for the system. Once all the requirements have been gathered, the design phase can commence. In this phase, both logical and physical models of the system are developed to provide a comprehensive representation.

After completing the preliminary phases, the implementation phase initiates the creation of the system. This phase consists of two parts: first, the specifications provided by the client and customers are translated into code and thoroughly tested. Subsequently, the client is presented with the developed work to gather feedback. Any necessary changes are implemented to accommodate the feedback, followed by further testing of the system. Once these adjustments are finalized, the system can be delivered to the client, accompanied by comprehensive documentation and training programs.

Finally, the maintenance phase is reached, signaling the beginning of system operation. During this phase, ongoing support and necessary updates are provided to ensure the system's optimal performance and longevity (Valacich & George, 2020, pp. 8-10).
